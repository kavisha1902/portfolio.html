h1>The best movies according to Kavisha</h1>
<h2>My top three movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>1.Soul</h3>
 <p>It is an animated movie by Disney which is really close to my heart and I deeply cherish it cause I find it extremely relatable. 
    It is quite eye opening and philosophical.</p>
<h3>2.Barbie</h3>
  <p>I have always held a soft spot for Barbies as I have adored them ever since I was a little girl.
     This movie really brings out the feminist in me. 
     It helped become more self aware and taught me how important it is to live life.</p>
<h3>3.Midnight</h3>
  <p>It is pure thriller korean movie which kept me on my toes throughout. I really loved the ending. </p>
